Hello, and Welcome to my page of projects

I've worked on programming a couple of small games, such as tetris and a game combining nesting dolls and tic-tac-toe. I'm also currently working on the Project Euler problems as well as a Crypto Modeling and Trading bot.

The languages and utilities that I have worked with are: C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, PHP, MYSQL

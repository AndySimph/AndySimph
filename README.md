Hello, and Welcome to my page of projects

I've worked on programming a couple of small games, such as tetris, snake, and a game combining nesting dolls and tic-tac-toe. I'm also currently working on the Project Euler problems as well as a Crypto Modeling and Trading bot using React and Expo.

I'm interested and have been taking classes in A.I. and Operating Systems.

The languages and utilities that I have worked with are:
